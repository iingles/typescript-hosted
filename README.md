# TypeScript - Use a REST API

In this assignment, we will be creating a simple webpage/web app that will display data returned from an open web API using TypeScript.

This assignment is essentially the 'Baseball Cards' project from DGM 1600.

## Steps

1. Select an open (no authentication required) API. - A few of my favorites are the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/) and the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) (More below, maybe use one you haven't used before. :smirk:)

## I used the Star Wars API.

2. Create a website.

3. Connect the website to the API and display data from the API.

## Clicking each button displays a different set of data from the API/

4. Add interactivity. (4 items) - Things like click for more information, and search are good ways to allow user interactivity.

## Each button changes the data retrieved.


## Requirements
* Source Code must be in TypeScript.
* Variables must be strictly typed. (Including function scoped variables.)
* Must make use of interfaces
* Must use a build process kicked off by a `npm build` command
* Must be hosted live
